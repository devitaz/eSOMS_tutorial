# eSOMS_tutorial
This repository contains the website tutorial I developed during my internship at Washington River Protection Solutions. This website is a MsSQL database-driven site, which utilizes Node.js for server-side scripting, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX for the client-side. There are some unusual functions in the server which require some explanation. This tutorial was developed for government use. It requires more "red tape", i.e. signatures, to make changes to the source code for a government website than it does to make changes to a database. A requirement for the assignment was that all the content, the text and images displayed on the site, were to be stored on an MsSQL database so changes could be easier to implement. This is why every time the website is accessed that the content is pulled from the database, and it gets written to its corresponding page view. The content being pulled from the database can be viewed in the "webpage-content.xlsx" file.
